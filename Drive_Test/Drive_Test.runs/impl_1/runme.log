WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net DirA_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin DirA_reg_i_2/O, cell DirA_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net cycle_A is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cycle_A_reg[19]_i_2/O, cell cycle_A_reg[19]_i_2.
