2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net DirA_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin DirA_reg_i_2/O, cell DirA_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cycle_A_reg[19]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cycle_A_reg[19]_i_2/O, cell cycle_A_reg[19]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net in0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin in2_reg[3]_i_1/O, cell in2_reg[3]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
